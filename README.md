# Firebase Studio

Here are the GIT commands used to begin to get what firebase studio built into GITHUB:
Removed the existing remote: git remote rm origin
This was necessary because a remote named origin was already configured.
Added the new remote: git remote add origin https://github.com/Ailyb/SocialFlowAI.git
This command added your specified GitHub repository as the origin remote.
Pushed the code: git push -u origin master
This command pushed the master branch to the origin remote and set up tracking, so future pushes will be simpler.
Now, all the files and folders from your current project are in your GitHub repository, and you can access it at https://github.com/Ailyb/SocialFlowAI.
